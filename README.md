# Intro

The following is the code challenge, which was supplied by Thesis, was created by Emmanuel Liens. Only HTML and pure CSS was used in the creation of this project. It's worth noting that the hamburger HTML and CSS was taken from an open source. I did not want to waste alot of time on a hamburger code when they tend to be generic in design/appearance. I apologize if the purpose was to build everything from scratch to test how far my knowledge extends in HTML and CSS. I do understand the purpose and function of all the code blocks supplied in the open source.

# Responsive changes

When it came to the responsive design I decided to remove the left hand portion of the design. Due to space, I felt the main purpose of the webpage would be to Sign Up, so I emphasized it by only displaying the signup form. Also, I removed the navigation links above so they can properly be displayed inside the hamburger when in 'mobile' form. In the footer, I switched the links to vertical to display more space.

# Extra Credit

It was mentioned to point out any flaws noticed in the attached design -- a possible flaw noted would be the hamburger appearing on the 'desktop' version of the design. Usually the hamburger would appear in the 'mobile' version. Another possible flaw noted is the contact link appears multiple times on the 'desktop' version. I would believe we want to reduce redundancy.

# Conclusion
Despite sending this challenge couple of days later, I did not spent the whole day working on this. Due to work / other responsiblities I broke up the time spent over several days. Thurs (~3 hours), Fri (~2 hours), and Sat (~1 hour and a half).
