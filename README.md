# ThesisCodeChallenge
The following is the code challenge, which was supplied by Thesis, was created by Emmanuel Liens. Only HTML and pure CSS was used in the creation of this project. It's worth noting that the hamburger HTML and CSS was taken from an open source. I did not want to waste alot of time on a hamburger code when they tend to be generic in design/appearance. I apologize if the purpose was to build everything from scratch to test how far my knowledge extends in HTML and CSS. I do understand the purpose and function of all the code blocks supplied in the open source.
